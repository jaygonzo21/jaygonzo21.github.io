                            <p id="back_text">In "This Is Water," David Foster Wallace employs logos by using 
                                logical reasoning to illustrate the importance of awareness and 
                                conscious choice in daily life. He presents relatable 
                                scenarios—like the monotony of adult routines and the automatic 
                                nature of thoughts—arguing that our default perceptions can lead 
                                to unexamined lives. By logically explaining how choosing to see 
                                beyond our own experiences can enhance empathy and understanding, 
                                he encourages readers to recognize their ability to control 
                                their perceptions and responses, ultimately advocating for a more 
                                mindful existence.</p>

                            <p id="back_text">In "This Is Water," David Foster Wallace uses pathos to evoke 
                                emotional responses and connect with his audience on a personal 
                                level. He shares anecdotes about the struggles of adult life, 
                                such as the frustration of daily routines and the feelings of 
                                isolation and existential dread. By addressing the emotional 
                                weight of these experiences, he resonates with the audience’s 
                                own feelings of disconnection and helplessness. His emphasis on 
                                empathy and awareness encourages readers to feel compassion for 
                                themselves and others, making a powerful case for living a more 
                                deliberate and connected life.</p>

                                In "This Is Water," David Foster Wallace establishes ethos by 
                                drawing on his credibility as a speaker and thinker. He shares 
                                personal anecdotes and reflections from his own life, 
                                particularly his experiences in college and as a writer. By 
                                acknowledging his own struggles with awareness and empathy, 
                                he positions himself as someone who has grappled with the same 
                                challenges as his audience. This honesty and vulnerability 
                                enhance his authority and trustworthiness, making his insights 
                                more relatable and impactful. By demonstrating genuine concern 
                                for the human experience, he invites readers to trust his

            <p class="default-text1">The default setting is an unconscience and automatic way of thinking. 
                We as humans natrually view ourselves as the center of the universe, because we see everything in 
                the first person. This means we have a self-centered point of view and always place our own 
                struggles above the struggles of others. We get up everyday to do the same things, the same 
                morning routine, brushing our teeth, putting on our shoes the exact 
                same way we did the day before, the exact same foot first. We drive to work or school 
                the exact same way, and we get frustrated at the same never ending traffic that lies in front 
                of us.

                    <h2>1. Awareness and Consciousness</h2>
                    <p>In order to escape the default setting, you have to be aware 
                        that you are running on "autopilot". Running on our default setting 
                        isn't wrong, it's just the way our brains were made to function. However, 
                        it is important to practice escaping the default setting so that we aren't 
                        limited by our own biases.

                    <h2>2. Choice and Discipline</h2>
                    <p>Wallace says that although the default setting is automatic, we have the freedom 
                        to choose how to respond to the world. Making that choice to act against our 
                        default setting is difficult, since the default setting is easy and saves energy.

                    <h2>3. Empathy and Perspective</h2>
                    <p>One of the most important ways to break free from the default setting is to try to 
                        be more empathatic towards others. If try your hardest to put yourself into 
                        someone else's shoes, you will realize that everyone is dealing with their own 
                        problems and struggles.

                    <h2>4. Living with Intention</h2>
                    <p>If you break free from the default setting, you begin to choose how you want to live 
                        and interpret your life. Rather than letting the mind 
                        automatically drift to thoughts of ego, frustration, or complaint, you can 
                        deliberately focus on what truly matters, such as kindness, gratitude, and understanding.
